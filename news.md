OpenCollar Dev/Beta/RC 3.931 HOTFIX

3.930 will have a parallel release on the main channel. It is strongly advised to use a red updater unless you want to get involved on the development side of things. The gap in between main and beta channels has been closed.

IMPORTANT: What we are working on here will be the final version of the OpenCollar as we know it. Those who will want to participate for 4.0.0 will have to be familiar with the old system and you all have now one more time the chance to take a look at it from the inside out together with us.
