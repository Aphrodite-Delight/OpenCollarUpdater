3.913 (Evolution)

ATTENTION: The update you just installed moved your collar to the final evolution branch for Q3 2013, leading your collar into the beta channel for now. That means from this point on you will receive beta updaters should you decide to stay on this channel for your collar. Until this branch should return to a more active development pace, evolution updaters will have to be acquired manually. If you just want to use your collar to have fun, please use a red updater right away. We are sorry for the inconvenience and extra-effort for your updating process in case you installed this version by mistake.
We would like to express our gratitude to Joy Stipe who demonstrated unmatched development pace and strength to make OpenCollar Evolution happen. Her improvements and fixes as well as the much more humane overall formatting in the source are part of OpenCollar now in total. While OpenCollar Evolution was based on OpenCollar, OpenCollar is now based on OpenCollar Evolution, making everything effectively just OpenCollar, be it for the sake of easing confusion with so many different variations.
